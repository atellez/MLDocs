		once Homebrew is installed, run (still in Terminal): "brew install maven"

	d. Eclipse

		go to Mac OS X 64-bit, and download file
		unzip file, then move unzipped folder into Applications folder

			or mycode folder in your home directory

3. Python

	b. python setup tools
		in Terminal, run "curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | sudo python"

4. H2O
	a. H2O - latest stable release
		http://h2o.ai/download/
		go to latest stable release (Nov 26, 2014: Maxwell 2.8.2.8)
		download H2O
		doubleclick on downloaded file to unzip (or unzip it some other way, I suppose)
		move unzipped folder (Entire Folder!) to Applications folder
		
	b. H2O - bleeding edge
		I suggest downloading this, As Well as the latest stable release
		http://h2o.ai/download/
		go to Bleeding Edge link
		download H2O
		double click to unzip, but do not move to Applications folder - leave in Downloads
		
	c. h2o-dev
		https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev
		on right hand side, select "Clone in Desktop"
		in Terminal, run: sudo pip install grip
		check that you have Java installed: in Terminal, run "javac -version" 
		in Terminal, run: brew install node
		navigate to your git repository -> h2o-dev
			(I set mine under ~/git_repo, so I can run "cd ~/git_repo/h2o-dev" )
		in Terminal, run: ./gradlew build
		(this is a working copy, build might not run the first time, don't be discouraged)
		(Nov 26, 2014: needed to copy "man-old" folder from /git_repo/h2o-dev/h2o-r/ 
			to /git_repo/h2o-dev/h2o-r/h2o-package as "man" )
		
		once a successful build is completed:
		in terminal, navigate to /git_repo/h2o-dev/build/  (cd /git_repo/h2o-dev/build)
		in terminal, run "java -jar h2o.jar"
		NOTE: KEEP TERMINAL RUNNING!!!
		in a web browser (Chrome), type "localhost:54321" in address bar and hit enter
		you will be directed to the h2o-Flow page, which is a editor of executable "cells"
		Please see "Appendix - Using H2O" for more information on using H2O
